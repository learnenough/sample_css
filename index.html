    <h1>The Learn Enough™ Story</h1>

    <p>
      Learn Enough™ to Be Dangerous is a leader in the movement to teach the world <em>technical sophistication</em>, which includes both "hard skills" like coding, command lines, and version control, and "soft skills" like guessing keyboard shortcuts, Googling error messages, and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing. We believe there are <strong>at least a billion people</strong> who can benefit from learning technical sophistication, probably more.

    <h2>Background</h2>

    <p>
      Learn Enough™ to Be Dangerous is an outgrowth of the Ruby on Rails Tutorial and the <a href="http://www.softcover.io/">Softcover publishing platform</a>. This page is part of the sample site for <a href="http://learnenough.com/html-tutorial"><em>Learn Enough™ HTML to Be Dangerous</em></a>, which teaches the basics of <strong>H</strong>yper<strong>t</strong>ext <strong>M</strong>arkup <strong>L</strong>anguage, the universal language of the World Wide Web. Other related tutorials can be found at <a href="http://learnenough.com/">learnenough.com</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      HTML was created by the original "web developer", computer scientist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Tim Berners-Lee</a>. It's not true that Sir Tim invented HTML in order to share videos of his cat, but it would be cool if it were.
    </p>

    <p>
      In addition to hosting most of the world's supply of kitten videos, the Web is also full of inspiring quotes, perhaps none more so than this one:
      <blockquote style="padding: 5px; background: #eee;">
        <em>Don't believe every quote you read on the Internet.</em>
        <br />
        —Abraham Lincoln
      </blockquote>
      Truer words were never spoken.
    </p>

    <h2>Founders</h2>

    <p>
      Learn Enough™ to Be Dangerous was founded in 2015 by Michael Hartl, Lee Donahoe, and Nick Merwin. We believe that the kind of technical sophistication taught by the Learn Enough™ tutorials can benefit <strong>at least a billion people</strong>, and probably more.

    <h3>Michael Hartl</h3>

    <p>
      Known for his dazzling charm, rapier wit, and fondness for over-the-top autobiographical descriptions, Michael is the creator of the <a href="http://railstutorial.org/">Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> and principal author of the <a href="http://learnenough.com/">Learn Enough™ to Be Dangerous</a> introductory sequence. Michael is also notorious as the founder of <a href="http://tauday.com/">Tau Day</a> and author of <a href="http://tauday.com/tau-manifesto"><em>The Tau Manifesto</em></a>, but rumors of his being a secret supervillain are slightly exaggerated. You should follow Michael on Twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/mhartl">here</a>.

    <h3>Lee Donahoe</h3>

    <p>
      When he's not literally swimming with sharks or hunting powder stashes on his snowboard, you can find Lee in front of his computer designing interfaces, doing front-end development, or writing some of the interface-related Learn Enough™ tutorials. You should follow Lee on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/leedonahoe">here</a>.

    <h3>Nick Merwin</h3>

    <p>
      You may have seen him shredding guitar live with Capital Cities on Jimmy Kimmel, Conan, or The Ellen Show, but rest assured Nick is a true nerd at heart. He’s just as happy shredding well-spec'd lines of code from a tour bus as he is from his kitchen table. You should follow Nick on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/nickmerwin">here</a>.
