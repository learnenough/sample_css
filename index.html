    <div class="callout-copy">
      <p>
        Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is a leader in the movement to teach the world 
        <em>technical sophistication</em>, which includes both "hard skills" like 
        coding, command lines, and version control, and "soft skills" like guessing 
        keyboard shortcuts, Googling error messages, and knowing when to just reboot 
        the darn thing.
      </p> 
      <p>
        We believe there are <strong>at least a billion people</strong> who can 
        benefit from learning technical sophistication, probably more. To join our

    <h2>THE FOUNDERS</h2>
    <p>
      Learn Enough to Be Dangerous was founded in 2015 by Michael Hartl, Lee 
      Donahoe, and Nick Merwin. We believe that the kind of technical sophistication 
      taught by the Learn Enough tutorials can benefit at least a billion people, 
      and probably more.

            Known for his dazzling charm, rapier wit, and unrivaled humility, Michael
            is the creator of the <a href="http://railstutorial.org/">Ruby on Rails
            Tutorial</a> and principal author of the 
            <a href="http://learnenough.com/"> Learn Enough to Be Dangerous</a> 
            introductory sequence.

            Michael is also
            notorious as the founder of <a href="http://tauday.com/">Tau Day</a> and
            author of <a href="http://tauday.com/tau-manifesto"><em>The Tau 
            Manifesto </em></a>, but rumors that he's secretly a supervillain are 
            slightly exaggerated.

            When he's not literally swimming with sharks or hunting powder stashes 
            on his snowboard, you can find Lee in front of his computer designing
            interfaces, doing front-end development, or writing some of the 
            interface-related Learn Enough tutorials.

            You may have seen him shredding guitar live with Capital Cities on 
            Jimmy Kimmel, Conan, or The Ellen Show, but rest assured Nick is a true 
            nerd at heart. Heâ€™s just as happy shredding well-spec'd lines of code 
            from a tour bus as he is from his kitchen table.
