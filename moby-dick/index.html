    Moby Dick by Herman Melville
  </a>

  <p>
    Call me <strong>Ishmael</strong>. Some years ago–<em>never mind how long
    precisely</em>–having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular
    to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the
    watery part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and
    regulating the circulation.

    <span style="font-size: 18px; color: #ff0000; font-family: sans-serif;">
    Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth;</span>
    whenever it is a damp,
    drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing
    before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet;
    and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it
    requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping
    into the street, and methodically knocking people’s hats off—then, I account
    it high time to get to sea as soon as I can. This is my substitute for pistol
    and ball. With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword;
    I quietly take to the ship. There is nothing surprising in this. If they but
    knew it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other, cherish very
    nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.
